# Typing-Speed-Test
A typing game made in Python with a tkinter GUI.
The main code to run this app is in venv/prototype_1_typing_test_tkinter.py. 
Behind the scenes, this will sift through texts (public domain passages) to create a list of phrases that fit within a certain size limit. 
After you type out the random passage, the program displays your time, accuracy, and a score which combines both.
